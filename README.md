##  Cloudinary Integration

- Video files are uploaded using the official **Cloudinary Node SDK**.
- Uploads are streamed to Cloudinary using `multer` and a configured `storage` engine.
- The resulting `secure_url`, `public_id`, and metadata are saved to MongoDB.
- Videos are played in the frontend via their Cloudinary URL (which supports streaming).
